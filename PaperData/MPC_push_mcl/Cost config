Costs used to perform these asyncronus MPC results were

Robot velocities
jointVelCosts: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.01, 0, 0.1, 0]

goal linear
linearPosCost: [ 8, 8, 0 ]
goal velocity
linear_vel_cost: [ 1.5, 1.5, 0 ]

Distractor objects
linearPosCost: [4, 4, 0]

terminal pos cost used only for final evaluation. of pos costs of all objects, goal + distractor.

Summing method
no delay in vis thread
